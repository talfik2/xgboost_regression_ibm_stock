In this repo, I applied XGBoostRegressor to IBM Stock Price Data(1962-Present) from yfinance library of Python. 

In this repo, I applied XGBoostRegressor to IBM Stock Price Data(1962-Present) from yfinance library of Python.

While applying XGBoost, I set base learners as Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression. 

As XGBoostRegressor is a regression algorithm, I evaluated its versions' by their Root Mean Square Error. After that, I compared their R.M.S.E. scores.

I also used Grid Search C.V. to set the best hyperparameters for a given algorithm.
